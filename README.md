This is visualized data from a dataBase.  

Used technology`s are pure HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript. 
Make it simple as possible with using DOM manipulation and iterating over an array of objects. 
Using FOR loop for iterating over the data base.
Taking their propeties , give them a class and put them in the div from a GRID system. 
Implementing IF....ELSE ... statements is for comparing quantities of the products , and if there is 0 qty the object will be given different class name, to be showed that there is a no availability of that product. 
When the properties are taken use DOM create and write elements for creating HTML elements with the taken values. 
The code is broken to a DIVs and different classes and it can be modified in a way much better looking page or list.
